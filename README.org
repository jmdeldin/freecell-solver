#+TITLE:       FreeCell Solver
#+STARTUP:     align hidestars indent

* Requirements
- UNIX-like system running Ruby 1.8.7 or better (1.9.3 preferred)
  This has only been tested on OS X 10.8.1.
- The =algorithms= package. This can be installed like so from the project root:

  #+begin_src sh
    gem install bundler # you may need to prefix this with "sudo"

    bundle install --binstubs .bin
  #+end_src

* Usage
#+begin_src sh
bundle exec bin/freecell INPUT-FILE
#+end_src

* Input Format
Input lines correspond to the following rules:

1. algorithm, specified as an integer code
2. number of suits
3. number of cards per suit, starting with A, 2, 3, ...
4. number of cascades (columns)
5. number of free cells
6. output level (0 = steps, 1 = 0 + description of each step, 2 = 1 + cells at
   each step)

The remaining lines are the initial deal of the game. The lines are ordered as
rightmost column (top row) to leftmost column (bottom row). The exposed card
is the card at the right (i.e., the last one in each row).

#+begin_src sh
5S AD 7S QC AH 7C # rightmost column
TD JC TC 5D 8H 6S
4S 5H 3S QD 9H 3H
8C 8S 7H 3D 4H 2D

TS 2H KS 9S KH QS 6C
JS 2S 8D 9D TH JD 3C
AC 2C 5C 9C QH 6D KC # leftmost column
